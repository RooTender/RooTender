# Hi, I’m @RooTender!

## About me 👋
I am a student at the Gdańsk University of Technology in the Computer Science field. I like to work on ambitious but rewarding projects.
My hobbies besides programming and problem solving are: maths, sailing, cooking, learning new things (for example new languages) and also cleaning.

### My strengths
- 🖐 I'm open to new opportunities and I like challenges
- 🧹 I like my work being organized, so I do my best to maintain the good quality of code and written algorithms
- 🤦‍♂️ If there's a constructive critique, I'm willing to make a change

### My weaknesses
- 🙈 Shyness, making presentations and publicly expressing myself is a huge challenge for me
- 🧐 Sometimes I pay too much attention to the details or overengineer basic solutions
- 😥 I tend to worry to much when things go wrong

## My favourite IT topics ❤
- Problem solving and interesting algorithms
- Optimizing or refactoring code
- Discovering new methodologies, approaches and data structures
- _actually C++_
