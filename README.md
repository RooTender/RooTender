# Hi, I’m @RooTender!

## About me 👋

I like to automate tasks, research and develop optimal solutions and work with data visualization (*It's really satisfying, you should try that* 😉).

## My favourite IT topics ❤
- Computer graphics and algorithms
- Optimizing data structures and refactoring code
- Procedural generation
- _Actually C++_
